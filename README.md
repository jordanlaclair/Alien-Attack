## Overview

Created in React ⚛️

This project was inspired by the GameBoy aesthetic. Overall, I had a lot of fun creating this project since creating my first game in web development felt like a journey/treat. I also learned a lot about CSS since it has a lot of styling. As well, I learned to use the useReducer Hook (or at least the very fundamentals) in React which is great when dealing with complex state.
